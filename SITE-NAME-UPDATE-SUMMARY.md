## 📋 Database Connections

**Important Note**: Database connection strings still use `breakthrough_trading` as the database name for compatibility. This ensures:

The site is now fully branded as **Concordial Nexus**! All user-facing content displays the new name while maintaining full functionality.

### Optional Database Rename
If you want to rename the database from `breakthrough_trading` to `concordial_nexus`:

1. **Backup your database** first
2. Create new database: `CREATE DATABASE concordial_nexus;`
3. Export data from old database
4. Import into new database
5. Update all connection strings in PHP files
6. Test thoroughly

### Additional Files
Some additional files may contain the old name in comments or documentation. These can be updated as needed but don't affect functionality.
